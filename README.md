# Traditional Chinese Study Tool

This is a pure JavaScript and HTML project for studying Traditional Chinese.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to provide a user interface for studying Chinese texts. The interface will be split into two panels:
- A top panel displaying the text under study.
- A bottom panel for interactions with the text, such as definitions, notes, and exercises.

## Features

- **Client-Side Only:** The application will run entirely in the browser, with no server-side component.
- **Responsive Design:** It is intended to work on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Local Storage:** User data, such as progress and notes, will be persisted in the browser's local storage.
- **LLM Integration:** In the future, [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) may be used to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced learning experiences.

## Development

- **Formatting:** [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for code formatting to maintain a consistent style.
- **Testing:** A simple testing harness will be set up for testing the pure JavaScript code.
