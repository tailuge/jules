    <h1>RLM by conductor</h1>

    <pre>
        ./rlm.sh -m gemini-2.5-flash-lite "What is 2+2?"
Starting RLM loop for task: What is 2+2?
--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM THOUGHT: The user is asking a simple arithmetic question. I can use the `bc` command to calculate this.
LLM ACTION: echo "2+2" | bc
Executing: echo "2+2" | bc
--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM THOUGHT: The `bc` command returned the correct answer, 4. The task is complete.
LLM ACTION: exit
RLM loop finished. See 'context.md' for details.
